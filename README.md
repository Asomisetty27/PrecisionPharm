# PrecisionPharm: AI-Driven Personalized Drug Metabolism Prediction

## Overview
PrecisionPharm is a machine learning algorithm designed to predict individualized drug metabolism rates based on genetic and biochemical markers. By integrating pharmacogenomic data with biochemical parameters, the model personalizes drug dosing, reducing adverse drug reactions and improving treatment efficacy.

## Problem Statement
Traditional drug dosing follows a one-size-fits-all approach, often ignoring patient-specific metabolic differences. Variations in drug metabolism enzymes, such as CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, along with liver and kidney function markers, significantly impact how individuals process medications. This leads to inconsistent drug efficacy and increased risks of side effects. PrecisionPharm addresses this issue by using AI-driven predictions to tailor drug dosages.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
   - Pharmacogenomic markers: CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 variants
   - Biochemical markers: Liver enzymes (ALT, AST), kidney function (creatinine levels)
   - Dataset normalization and encoding for compatibility with machine learning models

2. **Model Architecture**
   - Utilizes a **Random Forest Regressor**, optimized for high predictive accuracy
   - Implements **automated feature scaling** using StandardScaler
   - Encodes categorical genetic markers for numerical processing
   - Splits data into training and testing sets for validation

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**
   - Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance
   - Evaluates predictions using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **R-squared (R²) scores**
   - Ensures robustness through cross-validation techniques

4. **Deployment and Scalability**
   - Saves trained models and preprocessing tools using **joblib**
   - Allows seamless integration into clinical decision-support systems
   - Designed for further expansion with real-world clinical data

## Impact
PrecisionPharm contributes to the field of **precision medicine** by offering a data-driven approach to personalized drug dosing. The algorithm’s ability to predict individual metabolism rates can help physicians make more informed decisions, leading to:
- **Reduced adverse drug reactions**
- **Improved medication efficacy**
- **Safer, more effective treatment plans**

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with real-world pharmacogenomic databases
- Expansion to include additional drug metabolism pathways
- Implementation of deep learning techniques for improved accuracy
- Web-based or mobile application for clinical use
